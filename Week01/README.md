# NodeJS
There are 2 challenges:
*1)* The first challenge consist to find hoe many times a word is found in a 4 different documents. So u need to read 4 files and find how many times a word is repeated in those 4 files. The software as fast as possible and as short as possible :slightly_smiling_face: .

Bonus point: Try to see how much time will take to run your code.

*2)* Repeat the challenge without use any async code (like Roith did in the end of the class) and see how fast it is :slightly_smiling_face:

There's also some reading to help you on your way
* Reading this article explains a little bit about callback vs promises https://developer.ibm.com/node/2016/08/24/promises-in-node-js-an-alternative-to-callbacks/
* This is a short video @marco did about chaining promises https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-siE_VmzhU
* This is a good one to see before you solve the challanges https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hkgfXyVP5k
* This is important https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kN1-tseJnt0&t=55s (we will use a lot of command line during class)
* In case you are rusty with Github https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKg7e37bQE
* There are obviously resources on https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/Node.js/tree/master/week1

Homework is not much so PLEASE spend a bit of time solving…  if it takes more then 1h youu are definitely on the wrong path. Have fun :slightly_smiling_face: :slow_parrot: :rocket: (edited)

Promises in Node.js - An Alternative to Callbacks - Node.js @ IBM
Promises are a compelling alternative to callbacks when dealing with asynchronous code. Unfortunately, promises can be confusing and perhaps you’ve written them off. However, significant work has been done to bring out the essential beauty of promises in a way that is interoperable and verifiable. The result is Promises/A+, a specification that has made its way into …
